📖 About This Project

Structural Elements 

This project is my personal portfolio, built with Markdown and converted into HTML. It highlights my skills, certifications, and projects in a clean, GitHub-friendly format.

It demonstrates key Markdown features like:

📑 Paragraphs for structured text

🔖 Headings for clear sections

📋 Lists (ordered & unordered)

💻 Code blocks with syntax highlighting

✨ Text emphasis (bold, italics, strikethrough)

🔗 Links & images for interactive content

📏 Horizontal rules for visual separation

📊 Tables (extended Markdown feature)
